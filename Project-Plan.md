#Summary

We are creating a web application for Dan's Bagel Shop that manages the companies various processes.
These processes include inventory management, task management, and customer interaction. 
The application will provide an interface for customers to order bagels and for staff to manage inventory and process orders. 
Customers will be able to track and modify their orders and manage their user account. The staff will be 
able to manage inventory, process orders, and see high-level transaction information of the company, depending on their position.

- The main technologies we will be using are GitHub, React, Django, and SQLite
- We will track our tasks using the GitHub Projects and Issue features


#Risk Analysis:

##Requirement Gatherment 
### Risks
- Miscommunication between the development team and the client
- Gathering too many or too few requirements
### Impacts
- The entire project may be developed incorrectly
- Upset client
- Poorly implemented requirements
- Unrealistic goals 
### Workarounds
- Constant flow of communication between developers and the quiet 
- Be candor and verbose in all communication

##High-level design 
### Risks
- Too detailed
- Leaving out critical parts of the project 
- Unclear goals
### Impacts
- Little room for adjustment once development begins 
- Future patching may be needed 
- Too much may be left up for interpretation
- Time waste
### Workarounds
- JBGE (Just Barely Good Enough) (textbook: page 23)
- Make S.M.A.R.T goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timely)

## Low-level design 
### Risks
- Overlooking important program interfaces 
- Leaving out key data/information
### Impacts
- Non-intuitive structure 
- Time/resources wasted 
- Bug introduction 
### Workarounds
- Make it readible enough for a tech-savy client

## Development
### Risks
- Developers being lazy settling for easiest solutions 
- Developer conflicts (philosophy or communication based conflictions) 
- Ignoring the plan 
### Impacts
- Time wasted on bug fixes 
- Quality of product will diminish
### Workarounds 
- Developer communication is very important 
- Developers need to be on the same page, and that page needs to be the plan 
- Coordination between team-members
- Happy attitudes

## Testing 
### Risks
- Not testing enough 
- Having bad test requirements 
- Too many 'smart' people testing the code 
### Impacts
- End users will find the bugs 
- Can't tell client with 100% confidence that we delivered on the product 
- Inaccurate testing 
### Workarounds
- Develop a testing framework that tests based on requirements 
- Have non-developers test it

## Deployment 
### Risks
- Bad tech support 
- Not having a bug-reporting system 
- Frustrated clients 
- Hardware issues
 ### Impacts
 - Angry users 
 - Wasted money/time 
 - No sales 
 ### Workarounds
 - Lots of communication between users and developers
 - Lots of real-world testing.
