## What went well?

#### Overall
- We basically finished off the project in this sprint, aside from some final testing and checking of requirements 
- We kept a consistent schedule of meeting 2 or 3 times a week
- We improved on our scrum stuff
- We finished all of our tasks for the sprint

#### Front-end
- We worked really quickly in this sprint. Whenever we had a task to get down, we got it down as fast as possible 
- The separation of work was nice and even
- The quality of the changes were good

#### Back-end
- We communicated with the front end better than in any other sprint and were able to get things done very quickly.
- Use of git to track changes was better than in other sprints.

## What didn't go well?

#### Overall
- There were some pull requests that broke the project. These are very time consuming and are best to avoid
- We kind of forgot that sprint 2 ended, so the transition into sprint 3 was a bit weird

#### Front-end
- Not a whole lot went wrong in this sprint for the front-end team. The changes made were solid and only improved the quality of the website. The front-end team also worked quickly and efficiently throughout the sprint

#### Back-end
- We could've tested changes better.

## What specific things you can do to improve

#### Overall
- Throughly testing code before submiting a pull request
- Keeping better track of time so we know when one sprint ends and the next begins

#### Front-end
- Before fixing a bug, check with other team members to see if a fix is already in place and just hasn't been submitted yet

#### Back-end
- Better tracking of story points and general issues.
