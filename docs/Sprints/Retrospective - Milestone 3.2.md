## What went well?

#### Overall
- We did a good job in this sprint determining exactly what needs to be done to finish the project 
- A lot of small annoying bugs were fixed, and some large features were improved
- We kept a consistent schedule of meeting 2 or 3 times a week
- We improved on our scrum stuff
- We did better at finishing all of our tasks for the sprint

#### Front-end
- We were able to keep on schedule and get everything we wanted to done this sprint
- We were able to make the website a lot nicer to use by fixing small bugs and adding features that make the site more user friendly
- The separation of work was nice and even
- The quality of the changes were good

#### Back-end
- We were able to quickly get the majority of things we planned for the sprint done.
- When problems arose we were able to fix those bugs in an efficient manner.

## What didn't go well?

#### Overall
- We are still having a hard time keeping up with updating Github project tasks
- Our in person meetings were a lot less productive this sprint, so working on productivity will be important for the next sprint

#### Front-end
- Some changes this sprint causes bugs elsewhere in the program, avoiding this is really important
- Keeping up to date with the back-end team a bit more would be good. We didn't do too bad at this, but there were times when the back-end had a feature implemented that we forgot about

#### Back-end
- We should have planned more, the workload was light.
- Though we finished a lot, we could have been more organized about the manner in which we did it.

## What specific things you can do to improve

#### Overall
- Be more productive during our team meetings
- Keep up to date with the projects tab on Github

#### Front-end
- Stay more up to date with the back-ends progress (again, this wasn't horrible, it could just always be better)

#### Back-end
- Keep in touch with front end more, and plan ahead better so they aren't waiting for us to finish features.
