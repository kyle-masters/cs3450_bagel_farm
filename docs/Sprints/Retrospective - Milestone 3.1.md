## What went well?

#### Overall
- The front-end and back-end team worked well together to get features finished in a timely manner
- When the front-end needed to start working on a feature, the back-end was sure to get the backend work for it down quickly
- We kept a consistent schedule of meeting 2 or 3 times a week

#### Front-end
- We gave ourselves a lot of tasks to do, and got most of them done
- Dallin and Brent were able to smoothly integrate their changes together, there were very few merge conflicts
- The separation of work was nice and even
- The quality of the changes were good

#### Back-end
- We were able to get the base of the back end running well quickly.
- The database was designed from the beginning and required minimal changes to implement basic features.

## What didn't go well?

#### Overall
- We could be better with the scrum stuff. Sometimes the quality of our standup meetings were not the best.
- We could have finished a few more features in this sprint if we worked a bit more efficiently

#### Front-end
- We weren't able to finish all of the features and had to push them into the next sprint
- We could have worked quicker and more efficiently

#### Back-end
- We over scheduled ourselves and didn't finish all of our tasks.
- Some of the ways of writing code was inefficient and had to be changed through the sprint.
